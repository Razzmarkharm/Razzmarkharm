# 👋 Hi, I'm Rorisang Ntelekoa

🎓 Diploma in Information and Communication Technology  
🏫 Cape Peninsula University of Technology  
📍 Based in Cape Town, South Africa  
🎓 I'm a final-year (3rd year) Information Technology student at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), currently specializing in systems analysis and application development.

💼 I am currently completing my Work Integrated Learning (WIL) at **Plums Systems**, where I serve as a **Business Analyst**. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of how technical solutions align with real-world business processes.

💻 My passion lies in **application development**—a dream I have nurtured since high school. From a young age, I envisioned myself building tools that solve everyday problems and improve user experiences. Today, I am proud to say that I’m living that dream.

🚀 I'm constantly learning and pushing myself to grow both technically and professionally. I enjoy turning ideas into software, collaborating with others, and using technology to create impactful solutions.
